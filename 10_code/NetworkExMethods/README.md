**Why ONNX**

-- More Universal Deployment
ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) enables seamless model deployment across diverse AI frameworks and hardware, ensuring interoperability and optimization. By adopting ONNX, developers can transfer models effortlessly between platforms like TensorFlow and PyTorch to various devices, from cloud services to edge computing. This compatibility enhances performance, leveraging specific hardware accelerations like GPUs and TPUs. As a result, ONNX streamlines the path from model development to production, maintaining consistent performance and broadening deployment possibilities.

-- Inference Time Optimization

Based on our  Experiment findings, five models, including three with transformer architectures and two BERT models, achieved an average inference speed optimization of 2X.
